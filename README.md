# 0x1D. C - Binary Trees

This repository contains solutions to the Binary Trees project for Holberton School. The project focuses on understanding binary trees, including their structure, traversal methods, and various types of binary trees.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

- What is a binary tree
- The difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- The possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- The depth, height, and size of a binary tree
- Different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Requirements

- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Your code should use the Betty style
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the standard library
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h
- All your header files should be include guarded
